This is the `.stowed` repository for my dotfiles, for use with GNU Stow. I keep this repository here in order to keep my configuration synced between multiple machines. Designed to run on Debian.

My configuration requires the following `apt` packages:
```
sway
waybar
wofi
kitty
tmux
neovim
fastfetch
hyfetch
starship
```
And the following `cargo` crates:
```
yazi-fs
yazi-cli
```
